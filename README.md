## Development

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Building

```bash
npm run build:github-pages
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `docs/` directory for GitHub Pages deployment, including the necessary redirect files.
